        <p>The first two games were made as a final for a class, Del being for a coding class I took in highschool and Neo Knight being for IMM 120 last semester.</p>
        <p>Tidy Bots was actually done this last weekend for the <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a>. Below is a screenshot, which you can click to be sent to where our game was uploaded.</p>
